This project explores three core areas in Artificial Intelligence:
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes Classifier.
- **Search Problems**: Implementation of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms for solving the Flight Route Problem and Wumpus World Problem.
- **Logic Programming**: Solving the Wumpus World and Scheduling Problems using logic-based constraints and reasoning.

## Requirements

The required dependencies are listed in the `env.yaml` file. Use this file to create a new environment and install the necessary packages.

### Setting Up the Environment
1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f env.yaml
4. Activate the environment
   ```bash
   conda activate <environment_name>

## Usage
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmzinc/AI_Search_Logic_ML.git
   cd AI_Search_Logic_ML
2. Activate the environment
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter server
4. Follow the notebook sections to:
    - Train and evaluate machine learning models. 
    - Solve search problems with BFS, DFS, and A*. 
    - Analyze logic programming solutions.
